This is solution for regular expressions coding quiz.
Write tests that check for the following validation:

·         First name: must be a string, no numbers or special characters

·         Last name:  must be a string, no numbers or special characters

·         Age: must be numeric, no letters or special characters. Use casting to take this information from integer to string.

·         Birth date: Formatted to MM/DD/YYYY. Get each piece as an integer (separate out day, month, year) and use casing to put it together into one string before checking with regular expressions.

·         Phone number: Formatted to (###)-###-####

Validate each field using regular expressions. If a validation error occurs display an error message to the user.
